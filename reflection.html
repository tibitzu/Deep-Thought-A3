    <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What went well</h2>
    <p>
      Trello was an awesome tool. It kept meetings short and allowed us to organize ourselves autonomously before, during and after tasks were completed. It was also a tool to see contribution to ensure workload was balanced evenly across the group.
      Most of the time, the group had little issue with communication and had shared expectations and goals. At our groups peak efficiency, the tasks were completed well and reviewed by each other.<br>
      All group members, except for one experiencing personal difficulties, had 100% attendance rate to meetings. This showed commitment to the group and made a big positive difference overall.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>What could be improved</h2>
    <p>
      The group focused too much on the code side of the project instead of the written content. we would have benefited from doing smaller parts over a longer time instead of finishing sections all at once like we did and then reviewing once.<br>
      The group would have benefited from closer inspection of the marking rubric. We did not balance our time invested for marks gained.<br>
      Throughout the project john experienced family difficulties which he says interfered with his ability to work on the project. Although out of our control, more concise communication would have allowed us to share his workload and cause a lot less stress. Towards the end this did improve. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>One thing that was surprising</h2>
    <p>
      Trello more than halved our previous meeting time. It was amazing just how much more efficient one tool made the group.
    </p>
    <h2>One thing we learn ’t about groups</h2>
    <p>
      Get onto everything early and produce a constant stream of work. Consistency leads to higher quality work compared to doing large batches 
    </p>
    <h2>The GitHub logs</h2>
    <p>
      The GitHub log shows Tibor doing the majority of the comments. This is because he oversaw updating the website with the content that everyone was writing. Group members contributed to the contents of the report through smaller documents that were then compiled

    <h1>Tibor's reflection</h1>
    <p>
      I was pleased with the group’s processes, how we mostly got onto the tasks at hand and how we all got along well. Elijah’s idea of using Trello really helped in organizing what needed to be done and I was thankful to John for implementing it. Jarrad was eager to fill in the spaces in the project as was needed after finishing his tasks, and Elijah did a lot of work with the presentation and formatting the report. I know that John had some personal matters which interfered with his work, but I do feel he could have communicated with us to let us know where he was at and placing his work into the folders that I provided so that we could see what he was doing and could give feedback as we went along. As a group, we were much more thorough in identifying what needed to be done so that we were prepared to hand in the assessment, though I thought that Elijah and John could have worked on their sections a little earlier although I understand that they were working on their other subject.
    </p>

    <h2>What suprised me about the course</h2>
    <p>
      It was surprising how much group assessments were worth in comparison to the modules, there does not seem to be much incentive to do the modules. Would not it be better to have 10 small assignments for 5% each, a personal profile worth 10%, a group project worth 20% and a presentation for 20%. Modules are where we are supposed to be doing our learning and yet people seem to have stopped doing them. I learnt that this subject is very much dependent on the group you have. We originally had 6 members then 5, then 4 and then John was not present for most of it, which means there were 3 of us.

      As I oversaw updating the website, as a result I am the main contributor there.

    <h1>Jarrad's reflection</h1>
    <p>
      I have enjoyed working with the same group once again I cannot take credit for any of the ideas this assignment, but I can thank Elijah and Tibor for heading the major coding parts of the assignment to have our artefacts.<br>
      The introduction of Trello has streamlined our meetings allow us to be shorter but has to me lacked some personable interaction as the meeting.<br>
      This assignment has appeared three of us have been working more heavily than one of us in the group not showing up as regularly as we would like and not checking in with us at relevant times so we can check where they are up to and how they are going.<br>
      Still this group experience has been one of the better ones I have worked in as mentioned before we have had no issues at all.<br>
      However due to my limited coding knowledge I sadly couldn’t render any assistance to creating the artifacts for the assignment, which the group was ok with but leaving me with feeling like I could always do something more.<br>
      That being said I did work my hardest trying to formulate how the group tasks. Despite not having the highest interest in it.

    <h2>What went well</h2>
    <p>
     Trello was an amazing tool that sped up meetings and made the project a lot more manageable. It was easy to show you were doing tasks and when you had completed them and removed a lot of confusion from what still had to happen. I think our groups method of do your part, have it reviewed move on was very effective.
    </p>

    <h2>What could be improved</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, as it got closer to the end, communication withered with some of the group causing unnecessary stress to thank you to Tibor for pushing to the very end with me. Group meetings often had tech errors with video cameras not working.
    </p>
    
    <h2>One thing that was surprising</h2>
    <p>
      How quickly Tibor picked up the python programing language. His quick adaptation made the map system a reality.
    </p>
    <h2>One thing we learn ’t about groups</h2>
    <p>
      The last stretch of a group makes or breaks it. I need to be ready to climb the final hill, even if everythin seemed fine
    </p>
    <h2>The GitHub logs</h2>
    <p>
      The GitHub log shows Tibor doing all the work but that’s because he was in charge of updating the website. Everyone else was working on their small parts elsewhere. We all contributed to the report in different ways but Tibor was the one to transfer that data to the website
