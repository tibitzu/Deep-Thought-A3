    <h2>The story so far....</h2>
    <p>For assignment 2, our group had significant difficulties in deciding on a project, at first, we were going to go with Marek Ivanov’s idea of an automatic toilet paper monitor and order app for the elderly and disabled. Marek expressed a desire not to go with this idea due to difficulties with his time. We then decided on doing a mix of Tai’s stock exchange companion and John’s Budgeting app, unfortunately it did not come through and Tai left the group. As a last resort, we used Elijah’s Dungeon and Dragons Spell Manager app.</p>
    <h2>Assignment 3 begins....</h2>
    <p>At the commencement of the assignment 3 period, we discussed as a group the idea of continuing with the Dungeons and Dragons Spell Manager, however a few issues arose. The most significant issue was that the app was a quite simple, one that could be done by a single person and did not really require the work of a whole team, furthermore, there was not much to talk about regarding our ideal jobs, or the tools and technologies required to implement it. In other words, The group decided that it would make a lackluster report.</p>
    <h2>And where to from here....</h2>
    <p>After some deliberation, Tibor offered to rework his project idea, adding more content, and generally filling it out to provide a project we could all sink our teeth into. Since two of our members were unable to continue, the remaining members all have a keen interest in game design and two members’ ideal jobs are in game design, so the project idea of a multiplayer roguelike was much more applicable than it was for assignment 3.</p>
    <h2>How the idea was formulated....</h2>
    <p>Tibor started playing table-top roleplaying games over 30 years ago and video games for about 25 years. One thing that he noted was that game titles were often very linear, with a set path that the characters are on, even when they do not look linear, in fact they are. He had always dreamt of making a truly open-world, open-ended video game. As games continued to evolve and games started appearing online in a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) format, games still had a static, linear formulated which is both annoying and frustrating. Tibor envisioned a game that would allow players to explore a world together which was ever expanding, where they could make their own paths through the world and even build their own locations.</p>
    <p>Elijah has been playing video games as long as he can remember, and has been enjoying table-top roleplaying games	 for 4 years now. He loves both the RPG genre and the roguelike genre so when Tibor suggested the idea, he was happy to contribute.</p>
    <p>Me being an avid gamer as well like most of the group this seemed like an incredibly good step in a positive direction for us, I think we all like playing games sometimes too much so being able to create a game keeps us focused and still enjoying the process throughout the coding and the managerial side of things as well.</p>
    <h3>Plans for No Retreat:</h3>
    <p>The plan for the multiplayer roguelike is to start small, although the game is large in scope, our limits are also great. As a result of our little experience, the plan is the create four main things; a map of a town where the players will start and can move around, a draft combat system with which to interact with monsters, a basic character generator to make characters with stats, and a welcome screen to start the game with some simple art on it. For parts we struggle to or cannot complete we plan to investigate what skills we may need, who else we may need to complete the project, and how we may implement multiplayer functionality and how may save the map content.</p>
    <h3>The Map:</h3>
    <p>The map will be simple. A landscape console with a wall surrounding a filled area of ground tiles, some houses which will be procedurally generated and a road running through it. A character represented by an @ symbol which the player can move around by using the keyboard arrow keys. The character will not be able move through the houses or walls but can move upon the ground and road tiles.</p>
    <h3>The Combat System:</h3>
    <p>The combat system is inspired by an online browser game Candy Box 2. This system is being developed by Elijah Goodlet. The core premise is that the two combatants will relentlessly charge at each other until one fall decided by their character statistics.</p>
    <h3>The Character Generator:</h3>
    <h3>Skills, jobs, Careers and Roles:</h3>
    <p>Jarrad our skills and jobs are diversified in such an way that suits all our natural abilities</p>
    <h3>Multiplayer Functionality:</h3>
    <h2>Group journal</h2>
    <h3>Week 1:</h3>
    <p>For week 1, we have assigned tasks. Tibor will be working on the map, Elijah will be working on the combat system, John will make a basic character generator, investigate the tools and technologies required and Jarrad will investigate how our career paths and skills will influence our ability to complete the project, assign roles, and determine who else we may need.</p>
    <h3>Week 2:</h3>
    <p>Week 2 is upon us; the map has been more difficult than originally anticipated; a dungeon generation algorithm was easy enough to create along with an @ symbol to represent the character navigating through the dungeon which Tibor showed to the group in our meeting, but how do we turn this into a town?</p>
    <p>Elijah started a simple combat system with text and bars showing how much health each combatant had.</p>
    <p>John and Jarrad have been working on report tasks</p>
    <h3>Week 3:</h3>
    <p>Tibor has created some houses by simply drawing the dungeon rooms onto the map and making them non-passable and making sure they do not intersect with each other; he says that he is having trouble rendering more than one thing onto the map, so he can make houses or static road that does not change position, but not both. Less than ideal.</p>
    <p>Elijah is working with the combat system with issues of targeting. The order at which combatants act also changes who they target.</p>
    <p>Jarrad has completed his write up careers, skills, and jobs.</p>
    <h3>Week 4:</h3>
    <p>Eureka! We have a map surrounded by a wall, randomly positioned houses of assorted sizes, 2 gates at random positions on the outer wall and a road that always travels between the two gates. Unfortunately, the houses sometimes land on the road. Tibor says that he is trying to fix it.</p>
    <p>Elijah has finished the core code but now needs to re-format it to be more accessible as a module for to be called on by different files.</p>
    <p>Jarrad has been assigned the tasks of writing up what roles we will assign and how we are going to go about testing the game.</p>
    <h3>Week 5:</h3>
