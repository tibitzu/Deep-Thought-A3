    <h1>No Retreat, a multiplayer roguelike</h1>
    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  </div>
  <br><br>
  <div class="content">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>We want to create a multiplayer game that uses random generation to create maps and saves those maps for the player or other players to access and revisit at any time. I often found that games are very static and lack dynamics, the game that we want to create will continue to grow as players play it, creating a feeling of world building and giving the players a sense of having an invested interest in the game itself rather than just playing a world that the game developers have created for the players to play in.</p>
        <h3>Landscape:</h3>
        <p>There is no shortage on roguelike products out there, in fact every man and his dog has created or tried to create one. From the iconic Rogue in ascii, which was the first, Angband, a roguelike set in Tolkien’s Middle-Earth, Dwarf Fortress, a massive project which generates a terrain, cities and even religions and lore, to more modern takes on the genre such as caves of Qud and Ultima Ratio Regum, there are no shortage of these types of games. Where our game will differ is the multiplayer aspects, persistent worlds combined with procedurally generated maps. The multiplayer roguelikes out there are as I described earlier static, and the ones that do have excellent random generation are not multiplayer or have persistent worlds</p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A roguelike game is a game that uses simple graphics on a 2D map which is procedurally generated. In this game that we want to create, the player’s characters are set in a world of pure fantasy akin to such setting as The Lord of the Rings or World of Warcraft. An initial map will place the characters in a town which has been randomly generated and as the player moves his character towards a new border, a new map on that map edge would be created randomly using a similar type of terrain to the previous one, all maps are saved and can be revisited later with added content randomly generated on return such as monsters, non-player characters and usable items, however sites and the terrain itself will remain static. Sites are locations on the map created when the map was randomly generated, not only does the game create content on a horizontal plane in the form of terrain maps, but also on the vertical plane down, in the form of caves and dungeons, and up in the form of towers and fortresses. Villages and towns are another form of site which will be displayed as a terrain map on the initial horizontal plane. Towns and villages will include non-player characters which will provide quests, items, loot and rumours which give details to the players about changes which have occurred in the surrounding areas. Towns may also include sites which create maps randomly on the vertical plane that also remain a permanent fixture within the world. Terrain outside of towns and villages will include monsters, loot, usable items, non-player characters and sites. Sites will include monsters, non-player characters, loot, and usable items.</p>
        <p>Players will be able to interact with each other via chat channels and will be able to form groups which will give them additional inherent benefits such as improved reactions from monsters and non-player characters, improved survivability, and enable them to travel together in carts, carriages, and boats which will be available for purchase with specified non-player characters in villages and towns and which give the group an increased movement rate across terrain and increased carry capacity for all that loot that they find.</p>
        <p>Loot will include money in the form of gold, silver, copper and tin coins, gemstones will be in the form of diamonds, sapphires, and rubies and will have an equivalent coin value displayed in the form of gold coin worth. Usable items will include various weapons such as swords, axes, daggers, and spears, these usable items will have a damage value which will be used in combat with monsters and non-player characters. Armour which will include Plate, chainmail, leather and cloth, these items will negate the effects of weapon damage.</p>
        <p>Characters within the game will have “statistics” or “Attributes” which will inform the game as to the capabilities of the characters such as Strength which will calculate the damage down by a character when attacking another, or constitution, which will calculate how much damage a character can take before that character dies also known as health. Characters will also have a class which has inherent abilities such as a fighter being able to equip and wield various weapons and armour, a mage being able to cast “spells”, or a priest being able to make prayers and resurrect the dead.</p>
        <p>Players can have multiple characters within a game, however, when a character dies (has their health reduced to 0) that character will no longer be available for play, their bones will be left in their place as usable item which high level priests can resurrect, thus making the character playable again.</p>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
        <p>Outside of the creation of the game itself a fundamental technology which we would like to employ is “The Cloud”, this encompassing cloud infrastructure, cloud computer processing, cloud storage and other benefits which are provided by the cloud and are pivotal to the function of the game both from a developer and the customer side. The benefit of using the cloud is at the root of how the game will be able to function and be experienced, Cloudflare (2021) & Ranger (2018), highlight that “Platform as a service” (PaaS) model is the most beneficial model of implementing the cloud as the tools and advantages are better tailored to software development with this sentiment also be transferrable to game development as well. PaaS gives the developer access to; Infrastructure for software development the likes of virtual servers and networking (this being able to be utilised for multiplayer gaming, processing demanding tasks on the ‘developer-end’ rather than on the user end. Specialized development tools for creating, testing, and maintaining software all in a safe and secure virtual test environment. Furthermore, access and the ability to use different operating systems means software is able to be tested for consistency, with the developer being able to maintain the quality of the software. Cloud storage and data management for both the game data, personal user data with the cloud service provider offering greater security to this data compared to if its handles by the developer. This also encompassing failsafe methods which in the event of data breaches or data lose due to disaster the cloud service provider will have greater resources to resolve. Lastly the ability to scale the resources at the request of the developer, thus, if demand for the game increases in users, more resources can be allocated be it more data storage or processing power but also working the same if demand lessens. All without being complicated for all parties involved and the economic benefits for the developer with having access to this infrastructure at a cheaper cost compared to doing it for themselves. So as displayed having deep integration with the cloud will allow us to be able to provide the best experience for everyone, on the developer side having access to the extensive tools and resources which are offered by cloud service providers when using the cloud are incredible more so when looking at the financial side of the project. Furthermore, for the users they have peace of mind that because of the game being on the cloud the downloadable file would be smaller, their data is secured and being able to have online multiplayer and file sharing. Thus, using the cloud be it provided by Amazon through Amazon Web Services or Azure by Microsoft will be very beneficial for the group in seeing the success of the project after creating the game itself. </p>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>Tibor - Head game level designer. Tibor’s job as head game level designer is to control and help a team develop all the levels for the game this means he would be the head of a team controlling the unit trying to turn the game into a reality thru advanced level design.</p>
        <p>John - Cloud systems engineer. Working as a cloud systems engineer john is responsible for all the storage that is needed on the cloud to wirelessly work and connect to servers worldwide as well as overall game stability using servers
        <p>Jarrad – Marketing manager. Jarrad's job as a marketing manager will be to market the game and build up an enigma around the game which in theory would allow it to sell better, this includes run social media accounts, update websites to fill in the public of updates that are coming to the game.
        <p>Elijah – Lead Software designer. Being the lead software designer Elijah’s main role would to be design and develop the over arching system that runs the procedural generated map and game mechanics that are fundamental to the games operating system and major in game mechanics.</p>
        <h3>Extra hiring positions:<h3>
        <p>To fully flesh the game out in its entirety we would need to hire extra professional in certain areas to fulfil the teams’ goals and desires for the project to get the team to the end goal we will need to hire additional staff to help us. This starting with 2 of the most important roles in the group the software design/development and game design/development, hiring and offsider for Elijah and Tibor would allow a lot more fluidity and build quality within the build to fully allow their ideas to flourish. By them having the extra hands and additional skills in python and respected coding languages they can further the projects goals and allow for more tidying up of the project in the future as well as the possibility for future expansions.</p>
        <p>For Jarrad having another marketer on the team would allow them to help me sell the product easier and allow for us to always get more funding if need be. Another benefit of having another marketer on the team is to help sell the game as well helping with website and social media marketing ultimately the more marketers the better for the start-up company. The next role would be a fluent role and a team decision due to the fact we have a cloud software engineer onboard to help us with game files and storage now and seeing this game starts first of all single player we do not need to upgrade it right away to multiplayer servers, this means the role could change depending on what the company needs this could be backup designers and or coders for the main project but an free role to choose from our perspective pool depending what we need the most at the current time.</p>
        <h3>Outcome:</h3>
        <p>The desired outcome is having a game which rather than having static levels, is dynamic, and constantly changing based on the actions of the players’ characters within the game. In all games that I have played, players are forced to progress through the game of the designers making have no real autonomy or choice, choices are an illusion, giving players a seemingly open-ended range of choices that are not really choices and stuck in a static world which is the same for all players. This game plans to change all of that, changing the very way games are created and played in worlds that are dynamic, constantly changing based on character choices, and bringing the fun back into gaming.</p>
